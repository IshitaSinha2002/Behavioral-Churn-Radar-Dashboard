<h1>Behavioral Churn Radar</h1>
<h4>The Behavioral Churn Radar Dashboard is an end-to-end analytics solution designed to analyze subscription churn by combining user behavior, operational friction, and payment stability. The dashboard enables both high-leve monitoring and deep-dive analysis to help identify not only how much churn is occurring, but why it happens and which users are most at risk.</h4>

<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<h4>The primary goal of this dashboard is to move beyond reactive churn reporting and support proactive retention decision-making. It helps stakeholders understand overall subscription health, quantify revenue exposure, detect early churn risk signals, and priotize retenion efforts before customer loss occurs.</h4>

<h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
<h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Power BI: Data modeling, DAX calculations, and interactive dashboard design</li>
    <li>DAX: CHurn metrics, risk scoring, and derived logic</li>
    <li>Excel: Source data preparation and structuring</li>
</ul></h4>

<h3>Data Source:</h3>
<h4>This project uses a synthetic subscription dataset designed to simulate real-world SaaS churn scenarios. The data includes multiple fact tables representing different dimensions of customer interaction:
<ul>
  <li>Subscriptions – User plans, churn status, and revenue</li>
  <li>User Activity – Daily engagement metrics such as sessions, features used, and time spent</li>
  <li>Support Tickets – Customer support interactions and resolution times</li>
  <li>Payments – Payment outcomes indicating billing stability</li>
</ul>
The dataset was manually created for learning and portfolio demonstration purposes and does not contain any real customer information.</h4>
