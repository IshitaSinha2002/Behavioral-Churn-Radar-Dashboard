<h1>Behavioral Churn Radar</h1>
<h4>The Behavioral Churn Radar Dashboard is an end-to-end analytics solution designed to analyze subscription churn by combining user behavior, operational friction, and payment stability. The dashboard enables both high-leve monitoring and deep-dive analysis to help identify not only how much churn is occurring, but why it happens and which users are most at risk.</h4>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<h4>The primary goal of this dashboard is to move beyond reactive churn reporting and support proactive retention decision-making. It helps stakeholders understand overall subscription health, quantify revenue exposure, detect early churn risk signals, and priotize retenion efforts before customer loss occurs.</h4>
